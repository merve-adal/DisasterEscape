# DisasterEscape
This game was developed with Adem Han at the DAF JAM event to raise awareness in memory of those who lost their lives in the earthquake disaster. I took part in the level design and coding of the mechanics of the project.The main character of the game is injured and tries to reach a higher place by climbing the collapsed floors. At the end of the game he escapes and reaches other survivors.
